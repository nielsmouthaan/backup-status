## Frequently asked questions

### The app doesn't work on macOS 15 (Sequoia)

See [this issue](https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status/issues/10). It appears to be related to a bug in macOS 15 (Sequoia). [Granting full disk access](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/controlling-app-access-to-files-secddd1d86a6/web) to Backup Status solves the issue.

### How can I get support?

First, check the [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status#frequently-asked-questions). If your question isn't answered, [create](https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status/issues/new) an issue.

### How can I request a feature?

[Create](https://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status/issues/new) an issue after [checking](ttps://github.com/nielsmouthaan/backup-status/issues) it isn't already asked for.

### The app doesn't start. What can I do?

Ensure Backup Status is copied into your Applications directory and run from there.

### Why do I need to grant permission?

Backup Status is a [sandboxed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox/) application ensuring your system's and data's protection. It needs your explicit permission to read your Time Machine configuration to access its status. Since this is a read-only permission, Backup Status isn't able to modify its configuration or any other file on your Mac.

### Why do I need Backup Status to start at launch?

Backup Status contains an agent utility that observes changes to your Time Machine configuration and stores its status so the widget can access and display it. Without this utility running, the widget is unable to do this. To avoid starting this utility manually, allow it to start at launch.

### How can I uninstall Backup Status?

1. Open Backup Status from your Applications directory.
2. Click `Quit & uninstall` at the bottom to stop the utility from running.
3. [Remove](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/add-and-customize-widgets-mchl52be5da5/mac) the widget from your desktop and/or Notification Center.
4. [Remove](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102610) Backup Status by dragging it to the Trash.
